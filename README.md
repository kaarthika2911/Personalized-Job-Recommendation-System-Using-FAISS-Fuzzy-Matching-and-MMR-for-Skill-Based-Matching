A job recommendation system that uses sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques to suggest suitable job openings based on a user's resume is presented in this study. A Skills List, a Job Listings Dataset, and user-uploaded resumes are among the various data sources that the system incorporates. The raw text data from resumes and job descriptions is standardised by a number of preprocessing procedures, such as tokenisation, lemmatisation, and special character removal. High-dimensional job role representations are produced by vectorising the preprocessed job descriptions using TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings. Key skills are extracted from resumes and job descriptions using a skill extraction module that matches them with a pre-defined skills list using fuzzy matching techniques. The system uses Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to balance diversity and relevance in job recommendations and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to conduct effective similarity searches in order to improve the recommendation process. A set of personalised job recommendations that match the user's extracted talents, guaranteeing diversity and avoiding duplication, is the end result. This method improves the precision and applicability of job recommendations based on user preferences and abilities while providing job searchers with a scalable, real-time solution.
